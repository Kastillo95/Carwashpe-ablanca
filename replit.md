## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Server**: tsx runs TypeScript server directly
- **Client**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations for schema management

### Production
- **Build Process**: 
  - Frontend: Vite builds static assets
  - Backend: esbuild bundles Node.js server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Static Assets**: Served directly by Express in production

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment mode (development/production)
- **Session Security**: Secure session configuration for production

### Business Configuration
- **Services**: Predefined car wash services with pricing
- **Business Info**: Contact details and hours
- **Admin Access**: Password-protected administrative functions
- **Tax Calculation**: Configurable tax rates for invoicing
